# KraxBot for logging

Decided to scrap this bot for my account and make it open source.

About
--------------
This is a simplified and more user friendly version of the bot I used to have on my main account. Logs messages, friend invites, removals etc. It does not save the logs.
This will **not** be updated.

Installation
--------------
Installing is easy, just download it and go!

Make sure you have Node 0.12 or newer installed.

Steam 0.6.8 is required.
Older and newer versions aren't supported at this time.

Configuration
--------------
Open the file LogBot.js and the first lines will be for configuration.
This might be changed in the future.

Running
--------------
You run the bot by executing this command in a terminal
    node LogBot.js
